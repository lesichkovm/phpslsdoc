        PHPSLS makes the deployment of your application a breeze.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Deploing the application
    </h2>
    <p>
        The "deploy" command can be used to deploy the application.
        The command requires one argument, which is the environment
        to deploy the applicatio to.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
       vendor/bin/phpsls deploy live
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        The command will deploy the application and when completes
        will open a browser window, so that you can quickly
        preview and test.

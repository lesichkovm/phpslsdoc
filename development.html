      Introduction
    </h2>
    <p>
        PHPSLS includes a simple method for developing your application.
        It will run a local instance of your application using
        the builtin PHP server.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Running the application
    </h2>
    <p>
        The "serve" command can be used to run the application.
        The URL is taken from the local configuration file at /config/local.php .
    </p>
    <pre><code>
       vendor/bin/phpsls serve
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        The command will open a browser window, and then will start the server.

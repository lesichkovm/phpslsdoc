    <h2>
      Introduction
    </h2>
    <p>
        PHPSLS includes a simple method of seeding your
        databases with data using seed classes.
        All seed classes are stored in the app/database/seeds
        directory.
        Seed classes must be named exactly as the name of the file
        reside into i.e. TableSeeder in file TableSeeder.php
    </p>

    <h2>
      Writing the seeder
    </h2>

    <pre><code>
<?php

class TableCountrySeeder {

    /**
     * Run the database seeds.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function run() {
        // Add your seed code here
    }

}
    </code></pre>

    <h2>
      Running the seeder
    </h2>
    <p>
        The "seed" command accepts two arguments. 
        The environment to be seeded, as well as
        the name of the seed class to be executed.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
       vendor/bin/phpsls seed local TableCountrySeeder
    </code></pre>
